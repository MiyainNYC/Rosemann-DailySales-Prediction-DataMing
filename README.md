# Rosemann-DailySales-Prediction-DataMing
This is the first project fulfilled all by self during my first Graduate year majored in Business Analytics. Attempting to run multiple models upon the given data-set and exploring data through multi-dimension analysis, I finally made it to predict daily sales for over 1,000 Rossmann Drug stores in the period of two months and created a robust Prediction Model inserted in Excel using the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio.
After doing the whole project, I achieved answering all the following questions:
What could greatly influence daily sales for a particular store? Do Rorsemann sales follow different patterns in different states? Can we forecast sales peaks for Rosemann?
The whole program can be summerized into three stages:
1.	Use R(ggplot2 package), Microsoft PowerMap, Spotfire and Tableau to do Exploratory Analysis;
2.	Build five Machine Learning Models(Time Series Linear Regression, Boosted Decision Tree Regression, Bayesian Linear Regression and Xgboost) by using R and Microsoft Azure Studio.
3.	Machine Learning Model Publishing.
