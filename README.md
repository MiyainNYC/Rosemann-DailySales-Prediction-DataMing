# Rosemann-DailySales-Prediction-DataMing


This is the first project fulfilled all by self during my first Graduate year majored in Business Analytics. Attempting to run multiple models upon the given data-set and exploring data through multi-dimension analysis, I finally made it to predict daily sales for over 1,000 Rossmann Drug stores in the period of two months and created a robust Prediction Model inserted in Excel using the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio.

After doing the whole project, I achieved answering all the following questions:
* What could greatly influence daily sales for a particular store? 
* Do Rorsemann sales follow different patterns in different states? 
* Can we forecast sales peaks for Rosemann?

The whole program can be summerized into three stages:

1.	Use R(ggplot2 package), Microsoft PowerMap, Spotfire and Tableau to do Exploratory Analysis;

2.	Build five Machine Learning Models(Time Series Linear Regression, Boosted Decision Tree Regression, Bayesian Linear Regression and Xgboost) by using R and Microsoft Azure Studio.

3.	Machine Learning Model Publishing.

> However, since it is the first data mining project I did, many stuff needed to be improved, such as:
* I was so tool-driven as to ignore exploring the business essence of this project;
* When presenting this project on class, the professor asked me "What is your conclusion". I then realized that I should have put results, or outputs clear and straightforward in the first place.
